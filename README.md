This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Commitlint Rules

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

```
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

Real world examples can look like this:

```
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```
fix(server): send cors headers
```

```
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types according to commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) can be:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Gitlab CI, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **chore**: add something without touching production code (Eg: update npm dependencies)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (Eg: adding white-space, - formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
